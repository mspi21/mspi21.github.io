Who am I? I'm mspi.

I study Information security at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://fit.cvut.cz/en){:target="_blank"} of the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en){:target="_blank"}.

I work as an Ethical hacker at Telekom Security (Deutsche Telekom / T-Mobile Czech Republic).

I am working on security research concerning secure utilization of open-source libraries.

I teach C programming (Programming and Algorithmization I) and C++ programming (Programming and Algorithmization II) practicals at FIT CTU.

Besides pentesting and teaching programming, I enjoy reading up on science, making stuff, breaking stuff, reverse engineering stuff and understanding stuff.

I am interested in philosophy and the axioms on which our modern ways of thinking and living are based. It is my view that we must think deeply even about simple things.

I'm an idealist.

I play and enjoy classical music, I like to cook. I try to be a Warrior of Light.

I am a slytherin. Always.

I care about user empowerment and being in command of one's online presence.

I sometimes write stuff for my [blog](/blog/).
