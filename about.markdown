Who am I? I'm mspi.

I study Information security at the [Faculty of Information Technology](https://fit.cvut.cz/en){:target="_blank"} of the [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/en){:target="_blank"}.

I work as an Ethical hacker at Telekom Security (Deutsche Telekom / T-Mobile Czech Republic).

I am working on security research concerning security assessment and secure utilization of open-source cryptographic libraries.

I teach C programming (Programming and Algorithmization I) and C++ programming (Programming and Algorithmization II) practicals at FIT CTU.

I enjoy reading up on science, making, breaking, reverse engineering and understanding stuff.

I am interested in philosophy and the axioms on which our modern ways of thinking and living are based. It is my view that we must think deeply even about simple things.

I'm an idealist.

I care about user empowerment and being in command of one's online presence.

I (will) sometimes write stuff for my [blog](/blog/).
